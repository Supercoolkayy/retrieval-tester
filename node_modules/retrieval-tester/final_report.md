# Final Report: Filecoin Retrieval Tester CLI

## What the Tool Does

This CLI benchmarks Filecoin/IPFS HTTP gateways for retrieval speed, reliability, and health. It tests multiple endpoints in parallel, collects advanced metrics, and outputs results in text or JSON.

## How It Helps Filecoin Developers

- Identifies the fastest and most reliable gateways for your use case
- Surfaces slow, failing, or misconfigured endpoints
- Enables automated monitoring and regression testing
- Provides data for improving Filecoin retrieval infrastructure

## Technical Overview

- Written in TypeScript (Node.js)
- Uses Node.js http/https for precise timing and download metrics
- Configurable concurrency, retries, and timeout
- Extensible: add more endpoints, metrics, or output formats easily
- (Optional) Rust FFI or WASM integration possible for even higher performance

## Key Challenges & Solutions

- **Accurate timing:** Used Node.js perf_hooks and low-level HTTP for precise metrics
- **Error handling:** Robust try/catch, retries, and exponential backoff
- **Scalability:** Concurrency control and async workers
- **Extensibility:** Modular code and clear types/interfaces
